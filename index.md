## Overview

Food Now is a web application to help find a place to eat on campus! With the multitude of options offered here at UH Manoa, choosing may be difficult. 

Food Now enables users to log in with their UH emails and:
* Search for eateries based on a list of categories
* Discover menu items at specific eateries
  * View the price of each item
  * Add items to a "cart" that tracks all items added and the total cost before arrival
* Locate eateries with a top-down view of the UH Manoa campus highlighting the location of the desired eatery.
